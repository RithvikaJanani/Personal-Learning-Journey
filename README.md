# 📘 Personal AI/ML Learning Journey

Welcome to my AI/ML learning journal!

This repository documents my day-by-day progress as I deepen my understanding of:

- Generative AI
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- AI Agents & RAG systems
- Foundational ML concepts 
- Research papers in AI

The goal is to build strong theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and research depth in AI.
